abstract = {Understanding the reasons for which current climate models fail to reproduce the low equator-to-pole temperature gradient of past warm periods is among the major challenges in climate science. We focus here on the role of atmospheric poleward heat transport. We use an aquaplanet general circulation model (GCM) to construct a regime diagram of this quantity as a function of surface temperature and its meridional gradient, encompassing the range experienced by Earth over the Cenozoic. We find that poleward heat transport increases with surface temperature over much of this range, but saturates in the low-gradient, high-temperature regime where it is most needed. We identify some specific dynamical feedbacks responsible for this behavior: increasing tropospheric static stability and poleward migration of the storm tracks as global-mean temperature increases.

The new model differs from previous models by considering the influence of CO2 clouds on the convective lapse rate and on the planetary radiation budget. Condensation of CO2 decreases the lapse rate and, hence, reduces the magnitude of the greenhouse effect. This phenomenon becomes increasingly important at low solar luminosities and may preclude warm (0°C), globally averaged surface temperatures prior to ∼2 billion years ago unless other greenhouse gases were present in addition to CO2 and H2O.

abstract = {The problem of deglaciating a globally ice-covered (“hard snowball”) Earth is examined using a series of general circulation model simulations. The aim is to determine the amount of CO2 that must be accumulated in the atmosphere in order to trigger deglaciation. Prior treatments of this problem have been limited to energy balance models, which are incapable of treating certain crucial physical processes that turn out to strongly affect the conditions under which deglaciation can occur. CO2 concentrations up to .2 bars are considered in the general circulation model simulations, and even at such high CO2 content the model radiation code is found to perform well in comparison with codes explicitly designed for high CO2. In contrast to prevailing expectations, the hard snowball Earth is found to be nearly 30 K short of deglaciation, even at .2 bars. The very cold climates arise from a combination of the extreme seasonal and diurnal cycle, lapse rate effects, snow cover, and weak cloud effects. Several aspects of the atmospheric dynamics are examined in detail. The simulations indicate that the standard scenario, wherein snowball termination occurs after a few tenths of a bar of CO2 has built up following cessation of weathering, is problematic. However, the climate was found to be sensitive to details of a number of parameterized physical processes, notably clouds and heat transfer through the stable boundary layer. It is not out of the question that other parameterization suites might permit deglaciation. The results should not be construed as meaning that the hard snowball state could not have occurred, but only that deglaciation requires the operation of as-yet undiscovered processes that would enhance the climate sensitivity. A brief survey of some of the possibilities is provided.},

    abstract = { The Neoproterozoic is a time of transition between the ancient microbial world and the Phanerozoic, marked by a resumption of extreme carbon isotope fluctuations and glaciation after a billion-year absence. The carbon cycle disruptions are probably accompanied by changes in the stock of oxidants and connect to glaciations via changes in the atmospheric greenhouse gas content. Two of the glaciations reach low latitudes and may have been Snowball events with near-global ice cover. This review deals primarily with the Cryogenian portion of the Neoproterozoic, during which these glaciations occurred. The initiation and deglaciation of Snowball states are discussed in light of a suite of general circulation model simulations designed to facilitate intercomparison between different models. Snow cover and the nature of the frozen surface emerge as key factors governing initiation and deglaciation. The most comprehensive model discussed confirms the possibility of initiating a Snowball event with a plausible reduction of CO2. Deglaciation requires a combination of elevated CO2 and tropical dust accumulation, aided by some cloud warming. The cause of Neoproterozoic biogeochemical turbulence, and its precise connection with Snowball glaciations, remains obscure. }

abstract = {Earth's obliquity would vary chaotically from 0° to 85° were it not for the presence of the Moon (J. Laskar, F. Joutel, and P. Robutel, 1993,Nature361,615-617). The Moon itself is thought to be an accident of accretion, formed by a glancing blow from a Mars-sized planetesimal. Hence, planets with similar moons and stable obliquities may be extremely rare. This has lead Laskar and colleagues to suggest that the number of Earth-like planets with high obliquities and temperate, life-supporting climates may be small. To test this proposition, we have used an energy-balance climate model to simulate Earth's climate at obliquities up to 90°. We show that Earth's climate would become regionally severe in such circumstances, with large seasonal cycles and accompanying temperature extremes on middle- and high-latitude continents which might be damaging to many forms of life. The response of other, hypothetical, Earth-like planets to large obliquity fluctuations depends on their land-sea distribution and on their position within the habitable zone (HZ) around their star. Planets with several modest-sized continents or equatorial supercontinents are more climatically stable than those with polar supercontinents. Planets farther out in the HZ are less affected by high obliquities because their atmospheres should accumulate CO2in response to the carbonate-silicate cycle. Dense, CO2-rich atmospheres transport heat very effectively and therefore limit the magnitude of both seasonal cycles and latitudinal temperature gradients. We conclude that a significant fraction of extrasolar Earth-like planets may still be habitable, even if they are subject to large obliquity fluctuations. {\textcopyright} 1997 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Planetary obliquity determines the meridional distribution of the annual mean insolation. For obliquity exceeding 55°, the weakest insolation occurs at the equator. Stable partial snow and ice cover on such a planet would be in the form of a belt about the equator rather than polar caps. An analytical model of planetary climate is used to investigate the stability of ice caps and ice belts over the widest possible range of parameters. The model is a non-dimensional diffusive Energy Balance Model, representing insolation, heat transport, and ice−albedo feedback on a spherical planet. A complete analytical solution for any obliquity is given and validated against numerical solutions of a seasonal model in the "deep-water" regime of weak seasonal ice line migration. Multiple equilibria and unstable transitions between climate states (ice-free, Snowball, or ice cap/belt) are found over wide swaths of parameter space, including a "Large Ice-Belt Instability" and "Small Ice-Belt Instability" at high obliquity. The Snowball catastrophe is avoided at weak radiative forcing in two different scenarios: weak albedo feedback and inefficient heat transport (favoring stable partial ice cover), or efficient transport at high obliquity (favoring ice-free conditions). From speculative assumptions about distributions of planetary parameters, three-fourths to four-fifths of all planets with stable partial ice cover should be in the form of Earth-like polar caps.},

abstract = {Identifying terrestrial planets in the habitable zones (HZs) of other stars is one of the primary goals of ongoing radial velocity (RV) and transit exoplanet surveys and proposed future space missions. Most current estimates of the boundaries of the HZ are based on one-dimensional (1D), cloud-free, climate model calculations by Kasting et al. However, this model used band models that were based on older HITRAN and HITEMP line-by-line databases. The inner edge of the HZ in the Kasting et al. model was determined by loss of water, and the outer edge was determined by the maximum greenhouse provided by a CO 2 atmosphere. A conservative estimate for the width of the HZ from this model in our solar system is 0.95-1.67 AU. Here an updated 1D radiative-convective, cloud-free climate model is used to obtain new estimates for HZ widths around F, G, K, and M stars. New H 2 O and CO 2 absorption coefficients, derived from the HITRAN 2008 and HITEMP 2010 line-by-line databases, are important improvements to the climate model. According to the new model, the water-loss (inner HZ) and maximum greenhouse (outer HZ) limits for our solar system are at 0.99 and 1.70 AU, respectively, suggesting that the present Earth lies near the inner edge. Additional calculations are performed for stars with effective temperatures between 2600 and 7200 K, and the results are presented in parametric form, making them easy to apply to actual stars. The new model indicates that, near the inner edge of the HZ, there is no clear distinction between runaway greenhouse and water-loss limits for stars with T eff 5000 K, which has implications for ongoing planet searches around K and M stars. To assess the potential habitability of extrasolar terrestrial planets, we propose using stellar flux incident on a planet rather than equilibrium temperature. This removes the dependence on planetary (Bond) albedo, which varies depending on the host star's spectral type. We suggest that conservative estimates of the HZ (water-loss and maximum greenhouse limits) should be used for current RV surveys and Kepler mission to obtain a lower limit on $\eta$ ⊕ , so that future flagship missions like TPF-C and Darwin are not undersized. Our model does not include the radiative effects of clouds; thus, the actual HZ boundaries may extend further in both directions than the estimates just given.

abstract = {Traditional definitions of the habitable zone assume that habitable planets contain a carbonate-silicate cycle that regulates CO2 between the atmosphere, surface, and the interior. Such theories have been used to cast doubt on the habitability of ocean worlds. However, Levi et al (2017) have recently proposed a mechanism by which CO2 is mobilized between the atmosphere and the interior of an ocean world. At high enough CO2 pressures, sea ice can become enriched in CO2 clathrates and sink after a threshold density is achieved. The presence of subpolar sea ice is of great importance for habitability in ocean worlds. It may moderate the climate and is fundamental in current theories of life formation in diluted environments. Here, we model the Levi et al. mechanism and use latitudinally-dependent non-grey energy balance and single-column radiative-convective climate models and find that this mechanism may be sustained on ocean worlds that rotate at least 3 times faster than the Earth. We calculate the circumstellar region in which this cycle may operate for G-M-stars (Teff = 2,600 to 5,800 K), extending from about 1.23 to 1.65, 0.69 to 0.954, 0.38 to 0.528 AU, 0.219 to 0.308 AU, 0.146 to 0.206 AU, and 0.0428 to 0.0617 AU for G2, K2, M0, M3, M5, and M8 stars, respectively. However, unless planets are very young and not tidally locked, our mechanism would be unlikely to apply to stars cooler than a {\~{}}M3. We predict C/O ratios for our atmospheres (about 0.5) that can be verified by the JWST mission.},

abstract = {Global energy balance models of the martian atmosphere predict that, for a range of total CO2 inventories, the CO2 atmosphere may condense until a state with a permanent polar cap is reached. This process, which is commonly referred to as atmospheric collapse, may limit the time available for physical and chemical weathering. The global energy balance models that predict atmospheric collapse represent the climate using simplified parameterizations for atmospheric processes such as radiative transfer and atmospheric heat transport. However, a more detailed representation of these atmospheric processes is critical when the atmosphere is near a transition, such as the threshold for collapse. Therefore, we use the Mars Weather Research and Forecasting (MarsWRF) general circulation model (GCM) to investigate how the explicit representation of meridional heat transport and more detailed radiative transfer affects the onset of atmospheric collapse. Using MarsWRF, we find that previous energy balance modeling underestimates the range of CO2 inventories for which the atmosphere collapses and that the obliquity of Mars determines the range of CO2 inventories that can collapse. For a much larger range of CO2 inventories than expected, atmospheric heat transport is insufficient to prevent the atmospheric collapse. We show that the condensation of CO2 onto Olympus Mons and adjacent mountains generates a condensation flow. This condensation flow syphons energy that would otherwise be transported poleward, which helps explain the large range of CO2 inventories for which the atmosphere collapses.},

	abstract = {We investigate the climate modes and climate evolution of Earth-like planets—speciﬁcally planets that receive lower insolation than the present Earth—to discuss the outer limits of the habitable zones (HZs) associated with main-sequence stars. The HZ outer limit is discussed in terms of the insolation above which a planet maintains liquid water on its surface (e.g., warm climate). We call this a “warm start limit.” However, an alternative outer limit exists above which a planet characterized by a snowball climate transitions to a warm climate, which we call a “cold start limit.” The cold start limit is determined by two different mechanisms: condensation of CO2 and maximum CO2 greenhouse effect. The threshold insolation is always higher than the warm start limit. We ﬁnd that for the initial few billion years following the formation of a planetary system, the location of its outer HZ limit does not evolve away from the initial warm start limit. It subsequently moves in accordance with the evolution of the cold start limit. We also ﬁnd that when the luminosity increase of the central star is slow relative to the decrease in the CO2 degassing rate, the location of the outer limit of the HZ may even move inward. We conclude that the cold start limit should be treated as the outer limit of the HZ given the prevailing uncertainties, including the evolution of the CO2 degassing rate and continental growth.},

calculations of the warming potential of reduced atmospheres on early Mars. We show that the strength of both CO2-H2 and CO2-CH4 collision-induced absorption (CIA) has previously been significantly underestimated. Contrary to previous expectations, methane could have acted as a powerful greenhouse gas on early Mars due to CO2-CH4 CIA in the critical 250-500 cm-1 spectral window region. In atmospheres of 0.5 bar CO2 or more, percent levels of H2 or
CH4 raise annual mean surface temperatures by tens of degrees, with temperatures reaching 273 K for pressures of 1.25-2 bars and 2-10\% of H2 and CH4. Methane and hydrogen produced following aqueous alteration of Mars' crust could have combined with volcanically outgassed CO2 to form transient atmospheres of this composition 4.5-3.5 Ga. Our results also suggest that inhabited exoplanets could retain surface liquid water at significant distances from their host stars.},

gases as well as by H2 + CO2 and CH4 +
CO2 mixtures at room temperature. A Fourier transform
spectrometer associated to a multi-pass cell, whose optics were adjusted
to obtain a 152 m path length, were used to record transmission spectra
at total pressures up to about 0.98 bar. These measurements provide
information concerning the collision-induced absorption (CIA) bands as
well as about the wing of the CO2 15 μm band. Our results
for the CIAs of pure gases are, within uncertainties, in agreement with
previous determinations, validating our experimental and data analysis
procedures. We then consider the CIAs by H2 + CO2
and CH4 + CO2 and the low frequency wing of the
pure CO2 15 μm band, for which there are, to our
knowledge, no previous measurements. We confirm experimentally the
theoretical prediction of Wordsworth et al. (2017) that the
H2 + CO2 and CH4 + CO2 CIAs
are significantly stronger in the 50-550 cm-1 region than
those of H2 + N2 and CH4 +
N2, respectively. However, we find that the shape and the
strength of these recorded CIAs differ from the aforementioned
predictions. For the pure CO2 line-wings, we show that both
the χ-factor deduced from measurements near 4 μm and a
line-mixing model very well describe the observed strongly
sub-Lorentzian behavior in the 500-600 cm-1 region. These
experimental results open renewed perspectives for studies of the past
climate of Mars and extrasolar analogues.},

However, it remains unknown how much gas could be released in a single event. We model the CH{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}4{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} release by one mechanism for rapid release of CH{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}4{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} from clathrate. By modeling how CH{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}4{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}-clathrate release is affected by changes in Mars' obliquity and atmospheric composition, we find that a large fraction of total outgassing from CH{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}4{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} clathrate occurs following Mars' first prolonged atmospheric collapse. This atmosphere-collapse-initiated CH{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}4{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}-release mechanism has three stages. (1) Rapid collapse of Early Mars' carbon dioxide atmosphere initiates a slower shift of water ice from high ground to the poles. (2) Upon subsequent CO{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}-atmosphere re-inflation and CO{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}-greenhouse warming, low-latitude clathrate decomposes and releases methane gas.

	abstract = {Explaining the evidence for surface liquid water on early Mars has been a challenge for climate modelers, as the sun was 
∼30\% less luminous during the late-Noachian. We propose that the additional greenhouse forcing of CO2
-H2 collision-induced absorption is
capable of bringing the surface temperature above freezing and can put early Mars into a limit-cycling regime. Limit cycles occur when
insolation is low and CO2 outgassing
rates are unable to balance with the rapid drawdown of CO2 during warm weathering periods. Planets in this regime will alternate between global glaciation and transient warm climate phases. This mechanism is capable of explaining the
geomorphological evidence for transient warm periods in the martian record. Previous work has shown that collision-induced absorption of CO2 -H2 was
capable of deglaciating early Mars, but only with high H2 outgassing rates (greater than 
∼600 Tmol/yr) and at high surface pressures (between 3 to 4 bars). We used new theoretically derived collision-induced absorption
coefficients for CO2 -H2 to reevaluate the climate limit cycling hypothesis for early Mars. Using the new and stronger absorption coefficients in our 1-dimensional radiative convective model as well as our energy balance model, we find that limit cycling can occur with an H2 outgassing rate as low as 
∼300 Tmol/yr at surface pressures below 3 bars. Our results agree more closely with paleoparameters for early martian surface pressure and hydrogen abundance.},

	abstract = {Geological evidence indicates that grounded ice sheets reached sea level at all latitudes during two long-lived Cryogenian (58 and ≥5 My) glaciations. Combined uranium-lead and rhenium-osmium dating suggests that the older (Sturtian) glacial onset and both terminations were globally synchronous. Geochemical data imply that CO2 was 102 PAL (present atmospheric level) at the younger termination, consistent with a global ice cover. Sturtian glaciation followed breakup of a tropical supercontinent, and its onset coincided with the equatorial emplacement of a large igneous province. Modeling shows that the small thermal inertia of a globally frozen surface reverses the annual mean tropical atmospheric circulation, producing an equatorial desert and net snow and frost accumulation elsewhere. Oceanic ice thickens, forming a sea glacier that flows gravitationally toward the equator, sustained by the hydrologic cycle and by basal freezing and melting. Tropical ice sheets flow faster as CO2 rises but lose mass and become sensitive to orbital changes. Equatorial dust accumulation engenders supraglacial oligotrophic meltwater ecosystems, favorable for cyanobacteria and certain eukaryotes. Meltwater flushing through cracks enables organic burial and submarine deposition of airborne volcanic ash. The subglacial ocean is turbulent and well mixed, in response to geothermal heating and heat loss through the ice cover, increasing with latitude. Terminal carbonate deposits, unique to Cryogenian glaciations, are products of intense weathering and ocean stratification. Whole-ocean warming and collapsing peripheral bulges allow marine coastal flooding to continue long after ice-sheet disappearance. The evolutionary legacy of Snowball Earth is perceptible in fossils and living organisms.

The precise knowledge of vapour pressure of molecular solids at all relevant temperatures is mandatory, but the published sublimation relations are not always accurate enough. All published experimental measurements, and empirical and thermodynamical relations for the vapour pressure of 53 different species in their pure solid phases are reviewed. For several species, we also calculate the vapour pressure with accurate thermodynamic formulae from the triple point down to low temperatures. For 27 species (H2O, O2, O3, CO, CO2, CH3OH, HCOOH, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C6H6, HCN, HC3N, C2N2, C4N2, N2, NH3, NO, N2O, H2S, SO2, AsH3, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe) we are able to propose vapour pressure relations, either empirical or theoretical, valid over a large range of temperatures, representative of astrophysical environments. All these relations are more accurate than those currently used in the astrophysical literature. In particular, most of the relations commonly used in the astrophysical literature are based on the data reported by Lide (2006) in the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, which are inaccurate for several compounds. The most problematic case is CO ice, for which a sublimation relation extrapolated from the liquid–gas equilibrium (Fanale and Salvail, 1990) is used in most of the models simulating the activity of comet nuclei.},

	abstract = {A model originally developed to explain the spectral albedo and emissivity of terrestrial snow is extended to the case of carbon dioxide snow on Mars. The variation of albedo and emissivity with wavelength is caused by the spectral variation of the absorption coefficient of solid CO2. The most important variables controlling the radiative properties are grain size and contamination by dust or water. Solar zenith angle and snowpack thickness are of less importance. The observation that red albedo is higher than blue albedo in the Martian south polar cap indicates that the snow is contaminated with red dust. The interband absorption coefficient of CO2 ice in the thermal infrared is 2–3 orders of magnitude smaller than that of H2O ice, due to the absence of hydrogen bonding in CO2. This allows CO2 snow emissivity to be sensitive to grain size, emission angle, and impurities, in contrast to water snow which is nearly a blackbody under all conditions. The emissivity of CO2 snow varies substantially with wavelength, so energy budget modeling should be done in spectral detail. The addition of a thin layer of water frost over CO2 snow dramatically raises the thermal emissivity but causes little change to the spectrally averaged albedo unless the underlying CO2 snow is dirty. Remote sensing of CO2 grain size, H2O content, and dust content may be possible. However, the design of a remote-sensing strategy awaits more accurate laboratory determination of the optical constants of CO2 ice.},
