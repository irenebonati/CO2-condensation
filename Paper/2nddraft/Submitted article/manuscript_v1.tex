The habitable zone is the region around a star where standing bodies of liquid water are stable on a planetary surface. Its width is dictated by the efficiency of the carbonate-silicate cycle, which has maintained habitable surface conditions on our planet for billions of years. This cycle may be severely inhibited by significant surface condensation of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice, which is likely to occur on distant planets containing high enough levels of atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$. Such a process could permanently trap $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice within the planet, diminishing its long-term habitability. Recent work has modeled this scenario for initially cold and icy planetary bodies orbiting our Sun. Here, we use an advanced energy balance model to consider both initially warm and cold rapidly-rotating planets orbiting F - K stars. We show that the range of orbital distances where significant surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation occurs is significantly reduced for warm start planets. Star type does not affect this conclusion, although surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condenses over a larger fraction of the habitable zone around hotter stars. Our warm start simulations are thus consistent with 1-D model predictions, suggesting that the size of the classical $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$-$H_{\mathrm{2}}O$ habitable zone in those earlier models are still valid. We also find that our cold start simulations exhibit trends that are consistent with those of previous work.

\section{Introduction}

During the course of its evolution, Earth is thought to have exhibited mostly warm surface conditions that were temporarily interrupted by a few sporadic cooling episodes, triggered by processes taking place in its interior, atmosphere, and host star. The resultant climatic changes can manifest as mild oscillations, or even as extreme snowball events \citep{kirschvink1992,Hoffman1342}, with Earthâ€™s surface being completely covered in ice. Nevertheless, the carbonate-silicate cycle, which maintains the balance of atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ between the atmosphere and the interior, has allowed Earth to escape permanent glaciation and maintain clement surface conditions throughout time \citep{Hoffman1342}.

However, large amounts of atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ on a cold enough planet, like is the case for some depictions of early Mars \citep{Kasting1991,wordsworth2013}, can have a detrimental effect on its habitability. A number of recent studies \citep{Kasting1991,Phumbert2005,Phumbert2011, Soto2015, Turbet2017} have shown that once $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ partial pressures exceed the saturation level, and temperatures are low enough, significant condensation occurs at the poles, triggering collapse (Figure~\ref{fig:Sketch}). The relatively high Rayleigh scattering of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$, and the resultant increase in the planetary albedo, further enhance the ice-albedo feedback \citep{Kasting1991} and keep the planet cold. Moreover, the high density of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice with respect to water ice can lead to subsurface sequestration of the former, removing it from the atmosphere forever, resulting in a permanent state of glaciation. Such a scenario potentially removes or greatly mitigates the role of the carbonate-silicate cycle in sustaining habitable surface conditions \citep{Turbet2017}.  

Thus, while the carbonate-silicate cycle has stabilized surface temperatures over time on Earth, this might not be the case for bodies orbiting other stars and/or located at different orbital distances, and having different atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ inventories. In particular, $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressures at large orbital distances are high enough for surface condensation and Rayleigh scattering to counter the greenhouse effect, directly impacting the width of the classical $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$-$H_{\mathrm{2}}O$ habitable zone \citep{kasting1993,KumarKopparapu2013, Ramirez2018}. 

It is therefore important to assess the role of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ in determining a given planet's fate. \citet{Turbet2017} have recently addressed this issue by using a 3-D Global Climate Model (GCM) to simulate the evolution of terrestrial planets across the habitable zone, and concluded that bodies remained fully frozen and exhibited permanent surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation at orbital distances as small as \textasciitilde $1.27$~AU from the Sun for an atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressure of $1$~bar. In comparison, 1-D calculations suggest that planets can remain habitable up to \textasciitilde $1.47$~AU at that $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressure level \citep{kasting1993,KumarKopparapu2013, Ramirez2018}. 
All of this suggests that $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ condensation in more advanced climate modeling simulations may have an even more detrimental effect on planetary habitability than previously calculated, possibly decreasing the size of the habitable zone as computed in 1-D models.
%The model developed by \citet{Turbet2017} thus implies a less distant outer edge of the habitable zone compared to previous estimates \citep{KumarKopparapu2013}. 

However, \citet{Turbet2017} had simulated planets with initially fully-glaciated surface conditions (cold start worlds) orbiting our Sun. In contrast, habitable zone planets that start their evolution warm (warm start worlds) may exhibit different responses to $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ condensation. Here, we employ an advanced energy balance model (EBM) to investigate the parameter space of surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ condensation for cold and warm rotating planets with different atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressures orbiting Sun-like (F - K) stars. We compare the cold and warm start results and discuss the implications for the width of the habitable zone.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Governing equations}
We make use of an advanced non-grey energy balance model (EBM), similar to that described in \citet{RamirezLevi2018} and \cite{ramirez2020}, which is itself based on  other similar models (see also \citet{North1979},  \citet{North1981}, \citet{Williams1997}, and \citet{vladilo2013}) to determine the presence of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation and its influence on the fate of bodies orbiting Sun-like stars. We study the evolution of Earth-like planets assuming cold ($T_{\mathrm{surf}}$=230 K) or warm ($T_{\mathrm{surf}}$=280 K) starts. The EBM is coupled to a 1-D radiative-convective climate model that provides the radiative transfer calculations. For a more detailed explanation of the model, the reader is redirected to \citet{ramirez2020}. 

The present model follows the radiative energy balance principle \citep[e.g.,][]{Williams1997}, according to which planets in thermal equilibrium radiate as much energy to space as they receive from their host star. The atmospheric-ocean energy balance is expressed as \citep[e.g.,][]{james1982,Williams1997}: 

\begin{equation}
\label{ebmeq}
    C_{\mathrm{p}} \frac{\partial T(x, t)}{\partial t}-\frac{\partial}{\partial x} D\left(1-x^{2}\right) \frac{\partial T(x, t)}{\partial x}+I-L\left (\frac{dM_{\mathrm{col,CO_{\mathrm{2}}}}}{dt}\right )=S(1-A),
\end{equation}{}

where $C_{\mathrm{p}}$ is the effective heat capacity, $T$ is the zonally averaged surface temperature, $x$ is the sine of the latitude, $t$ is time, $D$ is the heat diffusion coefficient (i.e., the latitudinal transport of heat), $I$ is the outgoing infrared flux to space, $S$ is the absorbed fraction of incident solar flux, $L$ is the latent heat flux per unit mass of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ (5.9x10\textsuperscript{5}J/kg; \citet{forget1998}), $M_{\mathrm{col,CO_{\mathrm{2}}}}$ is the column mass of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ which sublimates from or condenses onto the planetary surface, and $A$ is the albedo at the top of the atmosphere over a given time step. This equation is solved for every time step using a second-order finite difference scheme.

The modeled planets are Earth-sized and are subdivided into 36 $5^{\circ}$ wide latitudinal belts with land and ocean coverage similar to present-day Earth (i.e., $70 \%$ oceans and $30 \%$ land). Flat topography is assumed for simplicity. Planets are in circular orbits and a day is 24 hours. For the calculations, we assume that atmospheres are fully-saturated and consist of $1$~bar $N_{\mathrm{2}}$ for a range of atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressures. The thermal diffusion coefficient $D$ is calculated using the following scaling relation (with the subscript "$0$" referring to present Earth values):

\begin{equation}
\label{hdiff}
    \left(\frac{D}{D_{\mathrm{0}}}\right)=\left(\frac{p}{p_{\mathrm{0}}}\right)\left(\frac{C_{\mathrm{p}}}{C_{\mathrm{p}_{0}}}\right)\left(\frac{m_{\mathrm{0}}}{m}\right)^{2}\left(\frac{\Omega_{0}}{\Omega}\right)^{2}\left(\frac{T_{\mathrm{surf,ave}}}{T_{\mathrm{0}}}\right)^{12},
\end{equation}

where $D_{\mathrm{0}}=0.58$~Wm\textsuperscript{-2}K\textsuperscript{-1}, $C_{\mathrm{p0}}=10^{3}$~g\textsuperscript{-1}kgK\textsuperscript{-1}), $p$ is the atmospheric pressure ($p_{\mathrm{0}}=1$~bar), $m$ is the atmospheric mass ($m_{\mathrm{0}}=28$~kg), $\Omega$ is the planetary rotation rate ($\Omega_{\mathrm{0}}=7.27 \cdot 10^{\mathrm{-5}}$~rads\textsuperscript{-1}), and $T_{\mathrm{surf,ave}}$ is the annual average surface temperature ($T_{\mathrm{0}}=288$~K). A crude temperature dependence is added to this equation to simulate the importance of latent heat release and transport at high temperatures \citep{Caballero2005a,Rose2017}. The exponent $12$ on the right side of Equation~\ref{hdiff} gives the right latitudinal temperature structure when comparing our results to Figure 1 from \citet{Turbet2017}, which displays an average temperature $T_{\mathrm{surf,ave}} \sim 225$~K. Without this temperature dependence, equator-pole temperatures gradients are underestimated and heat transport is overestimated at cold temperatures.

The model is able to distinguish between land, ocean, ice, and clouds. As the atmosphere warms near and above the freezing point, water clouds form, with the latitudinal cloud coverage ($c$) dictated by:
\begin{equation}
\label{cloud_coverage}
    c = \min \left ( 0.72 \log \left( \frac{F_{\mathrm{C}}}{F_{\mathrm{E}}} + 1 \right ),1 \right ).
\end{equation}
Here, $F_\mathrm{C}$ is the convective heat flux, $F_\mathrm{E}$ is the convective heat flux for the Earth at $288$~K ($\sim 90$~W/m$^2$). This equation is similar to that used in the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) GCM \citep{xu1991, yang2014} and yields an Earth-like cloud cover ($c$) of $\sim 50 \%$ at a mean surface temperature $T_{\mathrm{surf}}=288$~K. 

For each time step, spanning about $2$ hours of a planet's evolution, the new average surface temperature is updated for every latitude belt following Equation~\ref{ebmeq}, along with the resulting $H_{\mathrm{2}}O$ and $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ inventories in the atmosphere and surface. The model simulates the entire year, including seasons, until convergence (i.e., until the average annual surface temperature does not change by more than \textasciitilde$0.1$~K) using an explicit forward marching numerical scheme. 

To validate our model, we compute the northward heat flux for a planet with $330$ppm $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ (i.e., similar to present Earth) and orbiting the Sun at $1$~AU at different obliquities by using the following expression:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{\lambda}}=2 \pi R \cos \lambda F_{\mathrm{\lambda}}=2 \pi R^{2} D \cos ^{2} \lambda \frac{\partial T}{\partial x},
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{\lambda}}$ is the latitudinal energy transport per unit length, $R$ is the planetary radius, $\lambda$ is the latitude (between $-90^\circ$ and $90^\circ$, and $\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}$ is the temperature gradient between different latitude belts.
The obtained flux, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:flow}, matches well with similar models used in past studies \citep[e.g.,][]{WilliamsPollard}.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Figures/Meridional_flow.pdf}
    \caption{Meridional heat flow for an Earth-like planet  orbiting a Sun-like star at $1$~AU, having an atmospheric pressure of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ of $3.3\cdot10^{-4}$~bar and obliquities $0^\circ$, $23.5^\circ$, $45^\circ$, and $90^\circ$. At low obliquities, heat is transported from the equator towards the poles, while transport in the opposite direction is favored at high enough obliquities.}
    \label{fig:flow}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Initial conditions and parameter space}
We model the evolution of Earth-sized bodies, orbiting  F0, K5, and solar (a G2) stars. We vary the initial $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ atmospheric pressure, surface temperature (cold and warm start), planetary obliquity, and semi-major axis. The initial conditions are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:ic}. If a planet starts out cold, there are no water clouds (initially) in the atmosphere. The global surface temperature is set to $T_{\mathrm{surf}}=230$~K, and the land snow fraction is equal to $1$ (i.e., the continents are fully covered in ice).

On the other hand, if a planet starts out warm, the surface temperature is set to $T_{\mathrm{surf}}=280$ K, with a land snow fraction of $0.5$. The fractional cloud cover from water vapor is $c_{\mathrm{H_{\mathrm{2}}O}}=0.26$ (resulting from Equation~\ref{ebmeq}). 
There are no $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ clouds in the initial step for either case (i.e., $c_{\mathrm{CO_{\mathrm{2}}}}=0$). These starting conditions are meant to approximately simulate the modeling conditions of \citet{Turbet2017}. However, after the initial step, both cloud coverage and surface temperatures are self-consistently calculated. 

Our modeled $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ clouds are non-absorbing, and thus radiatively inactive. This is consistent with recent simulations suggesting that their greenhouse effect may be very small in these dense $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ atmospheres \citep{kitzmann2016}. Even so, our $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ clouds still impact the planetary albedo, affecting planetary surface temperatures and $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ precipitation. Following GCM predictions \citep{forget2013}, a 50 percent cloud cover is assumed for $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ clouds forming within a given latitude band. 


We explore different parameters as shown in Table~\ref{tab:parameters}. We do not simulate planets located at larger semi-major axis distances than those showed in Table~\ref{tab:parameters} because modeled surface temperatures at these $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressures are below what is possible for our radiative transfer model ($T_{\mathrm{surf}}=150$~K). Nevertheless, the sampled parameter space is more than sufficient to obtain the overall trends.

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{Initial conditions for planets starting out cold and warm.}
	\label{tab:ic}
	\begin{tabular}{ccc} 
		\hline
		Parameter & \textbf{Cold start} & \textbf{Warm start} \\

		Land snow fraction & 1 & 0.5 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

% Similarly to \citet{Turbet2017}, the $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ clouds in our model do not absorb at any wavelengths, and thus radiatively inactive. However, even though non-absorbing, the $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ clouds still impact the planetary albedo. Their presence therefore influences the planetary surface temperature and the precipitation of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$.

\subsection{Steady-state climate regimes}

Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all} shows the steady-state climate regimes obtained for initially cold and warm Earth-sized bodies with obliquity $23.5^{\circ}$ orbiting different types of stars (Sun-like, as well as F0 and K5 stars), as a function of their orbital distance and the initial atmospheric pressure of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$. We distinguish between four final scenarios: In the first one, the planet is completely ice-free (dark red areas in Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}). In the second one, the planet is partially covered in $H_{\mathrm{2}}O$ ice (light red areas in Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}). In the third one, the planet is partially covered in both $H_{\mathrm{2}}O$ ice and (permanent) $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice at the poles (light blue areas in Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}). In the last one, the planet is fully ice-covered and permanent $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice is present on the planetary surface (blue areas in Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}. Permanent $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice forms when condensation fluxes during the winter months do not balance sublimation taking place in the summer. 

As expected, surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation occurs at smaller orbital distances for cold start planets (left panels in Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}) compared to bodies starting out warm (right panels in Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}).
For the solar case, the $1$~bar $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ cold start scenario exhibits surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation starting from orbital distances as small as $\sim1.2$~AU, which compares favorably to the $1.27$~AU value found by \citet{Turbet2017}. The equivalent distances for the F0 and K5 stars are $\sim2.4$~AU and $\sim0.52$~AU, respectively.
In contrast, surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation for warm starts does not occur until $\sim1.38$~AU for the $1$~bar $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ solar case, almost  $0.2$~AU farther out than for the cold start scenario. At this same pressure level, $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ surface ice starts forming at $\sim2.7$~AU and $\sim0.58$~AU for the F0 and K5 stars, respectively. This is about $0.03$~AU and $0.06$~AU farther out than for the equivalent cold start cases.
The distances beyond which surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation starts forming are pressure-dependent, as a result of the greenhouse effect exerted by $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$. At higher pressures, surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation in both warm and cold start cases occurs farther away from the host star, whereas the opposite takes place at lower pressures.

Moreover, the surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation encompasses a larger region for the hotter stars (alternatively, the red region is larger for cooler stars). This is because near-infrared absorption is lower and Rayleigh scattering is higher for planetary atmospheres orbiting hotter stars, cooling the planet and causing $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ surface ice condensation to occur closer to the star. For comparison, 1-D radiative-convective climate modeling simulations predict that planets with a $1$~bar $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ atmosphere orbiting F0, solar, and K5 stars can remain habitable at distances as far as $\sim 2.75$, $1.47$, and $0.58$~AU, respectively \citep{kasting1993, KumarKopparapu2013,Ramirez2018}, assuming the luminosity values given in Table~\ref{tab:parameters}. These values are only slightly farther out than the most distant extent of the red regions at the $1$~bar level (Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}). Although nearly the same size, the warm regions in the warm starts still span slightly smaller areas (generally) than predicted in 1-D radiative-convective climate modeling simulations \citep{kasting1993, KumarKopparapu2013,Ramirez2018}. This is because of the EBM's increased ice-albedo feedback.

A key observation from our cold starts is that a planet cannot escape full glaciation for orbital distances exceeding $\sim 2.55$~AU, $\sim1.33$~AU, and $\sim0.58$~AU for the F0, solar, and K5 star cold start scenarios (Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}). In these cases, the planet remains glaciated with surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation regardless of the atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ content (Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}). This difference is attributed to the weaker heat transport and higher surface albedo associated with such cold starts. Although \citet{Turbet2017} does not necessarily obtain $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ surface ice in all of these cases, in agreement with our model, they predict snowball states. 

\subsection{Latitudinal variation of surface temperature}
\label{sec:surf_temp}
The  average surface temperature at the last time step as a function of latitude is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:comp_a0}, for both initially cold and warm planets having $1$~bar of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ in their atmospheres and obliquities $23.5^{\circ}$ and $0^{\circ}$. Low obliquity bodies receive more direct insulation at the equator, which causes large temperature differences between the latter and the poles, as well as generally lower polar surface temperatures. This also produced the tendency for equatorial surface temperatures to be higher at $0^{\circ}$ compared to $23.5^{\circ}$ obliquity, especially at higher $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressures. This, in turn, would cause more surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice to be present at higher ($23.5^{\circ}$) obliquity (see Figure~\ref{fig:CO2_ice}).
% We find that obliquity variations impact surface temperature distributions the most when the planet is not located near the boundary between the warm red and cold blue regions (Figure \ref{fig:ss_all}). In contrast, near or at these transitions, such obliquity effects are outstripped by the ice-albedo feedback. Thus, the size of the habitable zone remains relatively unaffected across the two obliquity levels.

We also find that the final state of a planet (i.e., whether it ends up being ice-free, partially ice-covered or a snowball) is not greatly influenced by obliquity variations for these dense $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ atmospheres  that are located near or very far away from their host stars (first and last rows in Figure~\ref{fig:comp_a0}). This is because at these distances, either the ice-albedo feedback (at farther distances) or the greenhouse effect (at closer distances) outstrip the impact of obliquity variations. This trend holds true whether the planet has a cold or warm start (Figure~\ref{fig:comp_a0}). However, at intermediate orbital distances (second row in Figure~\ref{fig:comp_a0}), close to the interface between the red and the blue regions (Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}), obliquity variations have a bigger impact on the final state.

\subsection{Fraction of surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice}

As shown by the Mars simulations of \citet{Soto2015}, the fraction of atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ that condenses onto the surface depends heavily on the atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressure and the planetary obliquity. Consistent with that study, we generally find that the amount of condensed $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice (i.e., the fraction of initial atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ that precipitates onto the planetary surface) is highest at low obliquity ($0^{\circ}$) and at low/intermediate pressures (Figure~\ref{fig:CO2_ice}). Such a trend is expected because equator-pole transport is relatively weak at low obliquities and pressures, which favors  $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation at the poles. 

At very low atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressures (i.e., smaller than $0.1$~bar), saturation is hardly ever reached, and even if the planetary surface is cold enough, $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ will not precipitate or precipitate in very low amounts (Figure~\ref{fig:CO2_ice}). 
%As a result, the fraction of atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ lost to collapse is very low, on the order of $1$~\% (Figure~\ref{fig:CO2_ice}).
Similarly, at high enough atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressures (above 2 bar) the greenhouse effect dominates and inhibits surface ice condensation, especially at lower latitudes. Under these conditions $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation becomes marginal (< 1 percent atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$) at both obliquities (Figure~\ref{fig:CO2_ice}), consistent with trends that were also found in \citet{Soto2015}. 
For pressures higher than $\sim2$~bar surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ condensation is slightly larger at higher ($23.5^{\circ}$) obliquity (Figure~\ref{fig:CO2_ice}). We attribute this to slightly less efficient equator-pole transport at higher obliquity for the highest pressures.

The atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice loss to surface is defined as the portion of initial $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ in the atmosphere that precipitates and gets trapped as permanent $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice on the planetary surface.} %For surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressures greater than $1.5$~bar, surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ condensation for all cases becomes negligible.}

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Implications for planetary habitability on early Mars, Earth, and exoplanets}

In agreement with \citet{Turbet2017}, our model also finds that $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ surface condensation can be a detriment to the habitability of cold start planets (Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}). As the dense surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice becomes sequestered within the subsurface, the atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressure decreases, which promotes even more ice formation, possibly leading to atmospheric collapse \citep{Turbet2017} . Unlike Earth, where volcanism ended snowball episodes \citep{Hoffman1342}, it might be more difficult for distant cold planets to avoid permanently glaciated conditions. This is because once $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressures exceed saturation, $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ is increasingly removed from the atmosphere before temperatures ever become warm enough. An exception to this could be volcanism rich in $H_{\mathrm{2}}$ or $CH_{\mathrm{4}}$, which could produce sufficient $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$-$H_{\mathrm{2}}$ or $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$-$CH_{\mathrm{4}}$ collision-induced absorption at high enough concentrations (percent level) and $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressures \citep{ramirez2014,ramirez2017,ramirezkalt2018}. Nevertheless, cold start planets that are close enough to their stars receive enough energy to circumvent the above problems (Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}). 

The above has a couple of interesting implications. Some studies argue that Mars (located at $1.52$~AU) was a cold planet that had undergone numerous transient warming episodes over geologic timescales, possibly aided by supplementary volcanic gases or other mechanisms in a predominantly $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ atmosphere \citep{wordsworth2013,batalha2016}. However, multiple sporadic warming episodes would be very difficult to achieve in practice because the excess $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ will be removed from the atmosphere once a warm period ends. This will not only enhance the ice-albedo feedback, raising the planetary albedo and triggering atmospheric collapse, but the atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ would be gradually removed from the atmospheric-surface system forever as it sinks below the less dense $H_{\mathrm{2}}O$ ice, making subsequent transient warming episodes much less likely. 

In contrast to our cold start cases, our warm start simulations suggest that the condensation of surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice affects a much smaller range of orbital distances. Irrespective of the star type, the range of semi-major axes and $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressures for which planets exhibit habitable surface conditions is similar to that predicted by 1-D calculations of the habitable zone \citep{kasting1993, Ramirez2018}. That said, warm start cases that are distant enough to exhibit significant $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ condensation suffer the same habitability problems discussed above for cold start planets. 

These results also have implications for our own planet. The Earth, by definition, is located close enough to the star where surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation is impossible under normal circumstances (Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}), and it would have been warm so long as the greenhouse effect, including from $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$, was potent enough. Nevertheless, the Hadean Earth likely had a $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$-rich atmosphere \citep{kasting2014}, suggesting that it was almost certainly a warm start planet, which may have possibly helped facilitate an early emergence of life.

\subsection{Comparison with previous work}
Although we obtain similar trends, our cold start results differ in certain respects from those of \citet{Turbet2017}. In particular, there are discrepancies in the spatial coverage of red (warm planets) and blue (cold and icy displaying surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice) colored areas in Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all} between the two studies, which are likely to be mostly attributed to  model differences (although there are slight differences in definition of the regions also). In particular, EBMs, such as this one, are quite sensitive to the ice-albedo feedback, and are thus more prone to abrupt transitions between cold and warm climate states \citep{RamirezLevi2018}. Our model also employs an atmospheric-ocean heat transport parameterization which likely produces different model behavior than the static ocean assumption made in \citet{Turbet2017}. 

Another reason for the differences may be in the treatment of clouds. For instance, our $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ clouds impact planetary albedo, but they are non-absorbing (see Methods). In contrast, the $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ clouds of \citet{Turbet2017} are either radiatively active or inactive across the entire spectrum. Nevertheless, other GCM results are consistent with 1-D results (and, in turn, the EBM results here) in the location of the outer edge of the habitable zone \citep{wolf2018erratum}.
Also, our warm start results agree well with those predicted from 1-D radiative-convective climate models \citep{kasting1993, KumarKopparapu2013, Ramirez2018}. However, it is unclear how GCMs with fully-coupled atmospheric oceans may compare with the results here. This would be an interesting consideration for future studies.

\section{Conclusions}
% The last numbered section should briefly summarise what has been done, and describe the final conclusions which the authors draw from their work.
Planets similar to Earth might experience cold or warm stages during the course of their evolution. The carbonate-silicate cycle can stabilize planetary temperatures over geological timescales. While  $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ generally increases surface temperature, high enough atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ can trigger atmospheric collapse via $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ surface ice condensation (starting at the poles), leading to irreversible glaciation. Such a process could negatively impact the habitability of terrestrial bodies, even if located within the canonical habitable zone. This was argued in \citet{Turbet2017}, whom showed that surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation on initially frozen planets orbiting the Sun can significantly reduce the range of habitable orbital distances. 

Our work here confirms these results and extends the analysis to rapidly-rotating planets under different starting temperature conditions orbiting a range of star types (F - K). Using a latitudinally-dependent EBM, we show that planets that start out warm can delay surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation to significantly higher $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressures and larger orbital distances than can cold start (i.e., fully glaciated with $T_{\mathrm{surf}}=230$~K) planets. This implies a wide habitable zone, consistent with what had been previously computed using simpler 1-D models \citep{kasting1993,KumarKopparapu2013,Ramirez2018}. Although our model predicts that this zone remains similarly wide across obliquities, we find that inefficient poleward heat transport leads to more surface  $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice production at lower ($0^{\circ}$) obliquity. 

The physics of planetary atmospheres remains complex, particularly for planets unlike the Earth. Future work should continue to use a hierarchy of models to explore the effect of clouds, convection, and the impact that oceans have on the overall heat transport.
