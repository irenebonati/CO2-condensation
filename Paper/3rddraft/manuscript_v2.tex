The habitable zone is the region around a star where standing bodies of liquid water can be stable on a planetary surface. Its width is often assumed to be dictated by the efficiency of the carbonate-silicate cycle, which has maintained habitable surface conditions on our planet for billions of years. This cycle may be inhibited by surface condensation of significant amounts of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice, which is likely to occur on distant planets containing high enough levels of atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$. Such a process could permanently trap $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice within the planet, diminishing its long-term habitability. Recent work has modeled this scenario for initially cold and icy planetary bodies orbiting our Sun. Here, we use an advanced energy balance model to consider both initially warm and cold rapidly-rotating planets orbiting F - K stars. We show that the range of orbital distances where significant surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation occurs is significantly reduced for warm start planets. Star type does not affect this conclusion, although surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condenses over a larger fraction of the habitable zone around hotter stars. Our warm start simulations are thus consistent with 1-D model predictions, suggesting that the classical habitable zone limits in those earlier models are still valid. We also find that our cold start simulations exhibit trends that are consistent with those of previous work for the Sun although we now extend the analysis to other star types.

\section{Introduction}

During the course of its evolution, Earth is thought to have exhibited mostly warm surface conditions that were temporarily interrupted by a few sporadic cooling episodes, triggered by processes taking place in its interior, atmosphere, and host star. The resultant climatic changes can manifest as mild oscillations, or even as extreme snowball events capable of engulfing Earth's entire surface in ice \citep{kirschvink1992,Hoffman1342}. Nevertheless, the carbonate-silicate cycle, which maintains the balance of atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ between the atmosphere and the interior, has allowed Earth to escape permanent glaciation and maintain clement surface conditions throughout time \citep{Hoffman1342}.

However, large amounts of atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ on a cold enough planet, like is the case for some depictions of early Mars \citep{Kasting1991,wordsworth2013}, can have a detrimental effect on its habitability. A number of recent studies \citep{Kasting1991,Phumbert2005,Phumbert2011, forget2013,Soto2015, Turbet2017,kadoya_outer_2019} have shown that once $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ partial pressures exceed the saturation level, and surface temperatures are low enough, significant condensation of $CO_{\rm 2}$ ice can occur at the poles (Figure~\ref{fig:Sketch}). The relatively high Rayleigh scattering of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$, along with the resultant increase in the planetary albedo, work to enhance the ice-albedo feedback \citep{Kasting1991} and keep the planet cold. Moreover, the high density of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice with respect to water ice can lead to surface condensation and subsurface sequestration of the former, removing some $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ from the atmosphere forever. This could result in a permanently glaciated state. Thus, a decrease in atmospheric $CO_{\rm 2}$  can prevent planets from achieving warm states. In that case,  the influence of the carbonate-silicate cycle in sustaining habitability is greatly lessened if not gone altogether \citep{Turbet2017}.  

While the carbonate-silicate cycle has stabilized surface temperatures over time on Earth, this might not be the case for bodies orbiting other stars and/or located at different orbital distances, and having different atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ inventories. In particular, $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressures at large orbital distances are high enough for surface condensation and Rayleigh scattering to counter the greenhouse effect, directly impacting the width of the classical $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$-$H_{\mathrm{2}}O$ habitable zone \citep{kasting1993,KumarKopparapu2013, Ramirez2018}. 

It is therefore important to assess the role of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ in determining a given planet's fate. \citet{Turbet2017} have recently addressed this issue by using a 3-D Global Climate Model (GCM) to simulate the evolution of terrestrial planets across the habitable zone, and concluded that bodies initially assumed to be fully frozen remained that way, exhibiting permanent surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation at orbital distances as small as \textasciitilde $1.27$~AU from the Sun for an atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressure of $1$~bar. In comparison, 1-D calculations suggest that the habitable zone extends to \textasciitilde $1.47$~AU at that $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressure level \citep{kasting1993,KumarKopparapu2013, Ramirez2018}. 
All of this suggests that $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ condensation in more advanced climate modeling simulations may have an even more detrimental effect on planetary habitability than previously calculated, possibly decreasing the size of the habitable zone as compared to 1-D modeling simulations.

\citet{Turbet2017} had simulated planets with initially fully-glaciated surface conditions (cold start worlds) orbiting our Sun. In contrast, habitable zone planets that start their evolution warm (warm start worlds) may exhibit a different response to $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ condensation. Here, we employ an advanced energy balance model (EBM) to investigate the parameter space of surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ condensation for cold and warm rotating planets with different atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressures orbiting Sun-like (F - K) stars. We compare the cold and warm start results and discuss the implications for the width of the habitable zone.

At the poles, the surface temperature is low enough to drop below the $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ sublimation temperature. The presence of a sufficiently high amount of atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ can, in turn, drive precipitation of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice onto the planetary surface. 
    Such a phenomenon is more unlikely to happen for a small inventory of atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$, or when the warming effect of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ starts dominating at high surface pressures. Adapted from Figure 1 of \citet{Soto2015}.}

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:Methods}
\subsection{Governing equations}
We make use of an advanced non-grey energy balance model (EBM), similar to that described in \citet{RamirezLevi2018} and \cite{ramirez2020}, which is itself based on  other similar models (see also \citet{North1979},  \citet{North1981}, \citet{Williams1997}, and \citet{vladilo2013}) to determine the presence of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation and its influence on the fate of bodies orbiting Sun-like stars. We study the evolution of Earth-like planets assuming cold ($T_{\mathrm{surf}}$=230 K) or warm ($T_{\mathrm{surf}}$=280 K) starts. The EBM is coupled to a 1-D radiative-convective climate model that provides the radiative transfer calculations. For a more detailed explanation of the model, the reader is redirected to \citet{ramirez2020}. We reiterate some of the key details here.

The present model follows the radiative energy balance principle \citep[e.g.,][]{Williams1997}, according to which planets in thermal equilibrium radiate as much energy to space as they receive from their host star. The atmospheric-ocean energy balance is expressed as \citep[e.g.,][]{james1982,Williams1997,batalha2016}: 

\begin{equation}
\label{ebmeq}
    C_{\mathrm{p}} \frac{\partial T(x, t)}{\partial t}-\frac{\partial}{\partial x} D\left(1-x^{2}\right) \frac{\partial T(x, t)}{\partial x}+I-L\left (\frac{dM_{\mathrm{col,CO_{\mathrm{2}}}}}{dt}\right )=S(1-A),
\end{equation}{}

where $C_{\mathrm{p}}$ is the effective heat capacity, $T$ is the zonally averaged surface temperature, $x$ is the sine of the latitude, $t$ is time, $D$ is the heat diffusion coefficient (i.e., the latitudinal transport of heat), $I$ is the outgoing infrared flux to space, $S$ is the absorbed fraction of incident solar flux, $L$ is the latent heat flux per unit mass of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ (5.9 \ $\cdot$ 10\textsuperscript{5}J/kg; \citet{forget1998}), $M_{\mathrm{col,CO_{\mathrm{2}}}}$ is the column mass of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ which sublimates from or condenses onto the planetary surface, and $A$ is the albedo at the top of the atmosphere. Equation \ref{ebmeq} is solved for every time step using a second-order finite difference scheme.

The modeled planets are Earth-sized and are subdivided into 36 five degree wide latitudinal belts with land and ocean coverage similar to present-day Earth (i.e., $70 \%$ oceans and $30 \%$ land). Flat topography is assumed for simplicity. Planets are in circular orbits and the length of day is 24 hours. As per \citet{Turbet2017}, we assume that volcanic outgassing rates at a given stellar flux are always high enough to support stable climates. Thus, our worlds do not undergo limit cycles, which lead to hypothetical oscillations between warm and cold climates for planets with low volcanic outgassing rates \citep{haqq2016limit,paradise2017,kadoya_outer_2019}. We note that the existence of limit cycles is controversial and is based on various weathering and surface albedo assumptions that may not be realistic or applicable in many circumstances \citep{ramirez2017mars,graham-a}.

Our calculations assume that atmospheres are fully-saturated and consist of $1$~bar $N_{\mathrm{2}}$ for a range of atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressures. The thermal diffusion coefficient $D$ is calculated using the following scaling relation (with the subscript "$0$" referring to present Earth values):

\begin{equation}
\label{hdiff}
    \left(\frac{D}{D_{\mathrm{0}}}\right)=\left(\frac{p}{p_{\mathrm{0}}}\right)\left(\frac{C_{\mathrm{p}}}{C_{\mathrm{p}_{0}}}\right)\left(\frac{m_{\mathrm{0}}}{m}\right)^{2}\left(\frac{\Omega_{0}}{\Omega}\right)^{2}\left(\frac{T_{\mathrm{surf,ave}}}{T_{\mathrm{0}}}\right)^{12},
\end{equation}

where $D_{\mathrm{0}}=0.58$~Wm\textsuperscript{-2}K\textsuperscript{-1}, $C_{\mathrm{p0}}=10^{3}$~g\textsuperscript{-1}kgK\textsuperscript{-1}), $p$ is the atmospheric pressure ($p_{\mathrm{0}}=1$~bar), $m$ is the atmospheric mass ($m_{\mathrm{0}}=28$~kg), $\Omega$ is the planetary rotation rate ($\Omega_{\mathrm{0}}=7.27 \cdot 10^{\mathrm{-5}}$~rads\textsuperscript{-1}), and $T_{\mathrm{surf,ave}}$ is the annual average surface temperature ($T_{\mathrm{0}}=288$~K). A crude temperature dependence is added to this equation to simulate the importance of latent heat release and transport at high temperatures \citep{Caballero2005a,Rose2017}. The exponent $12$ on the right side of Equation~\ref{hdiff} gives the right latitudinal temperature structure when comparing our results to Figure 1 from \citet{Turbet2017}, which displays an average temperature $T_{\mathrm{surf,ave}} \sim 225$~K. Without this temperature dependence, equator-pole temperature gradients are underestimated and heat transport is overestimated at cold temperatures.

The model is able to distinguish between land, ocean, ice, and clouds. As the atmosphere warms near and above the freezing point, water clouds form, with the latitudinal cloud coverage ($c$) dictated by:
\begin{equation}
\label{cloud_coverage}
    c = \min \left ( 0.72 \log \left( \frac{F_{\mathrm{C}}}{F_{\mathrm{E}}} + 1 \right ),1 \right ).
\end{equation}
Here, $F_\mathrm{C}$ is the convective heat flux, $F_\mathrm{E}$ is the convective heat flux for the Earth at $288$~K ($\sim 90$~W/m$^2$). This equation is similar to that used in the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) GCM \citep{xu1991, yang2014} and yields an Earth-like cloud coverage $c\sim 50 \%$ at a mean surface temperature $T_{\mathrm{surf}}=288$~K. 

Our modeled $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ clouds are non-absorbing, and thus radiatively inactive. This is consistent with recent simulations suggesting that their greenhouse effect may be very small in these dense $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ atmospheres \citep{kitzmann2016}. Even so, our $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ clouds still impact the planetary albedo, affecting planetary surface temperatures and $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ precipitation. Following GCM predictions \citep{forget2013}, a cloud coverage $c=50 \%$ is assumed for $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ clouds forming within a given latitude band. 

For each time step, spanning about $2$ hours of a planet's evolution, the new average surface temperature is updated for every latitude belt following Equation~\ref{ebmeq}, along with the resulting $H_{\mathrm{2}}O$ and $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ inventories in the atmosphere and surface. The model simulates the entire year, including seasons, using an explicit forward marching numerical scheme to achieve convergence. Such convergence is reached when the average annual surface temperature does not change by more than \textasciitilde$0.1$~K and both $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ condensation and sublimation rates are balanced. 

To validate our model, we compute the northward heat flux for a planet with $330$~ppm $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ (i.e., similar to present Earth) and orbiting the Sun at $1$~AU at different obliquities by using the following expression:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{\lambda}}=2 \pi R \cos \lambda F_{\mathrm{\lambda}}=2 \pi R^{2} D \cos ^{2} \lambda \frac{\partial T}{\partial x},
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{\lambda}}$ is the latitudinal energy transport per unit length, $R$ is the planetary radius, $\lambda$ is the latitude (between $-90^\circ$ and $90^\circ$, and $\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}$ is the temperature gradient between different latitude belts.
The obtained flux, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:flow}, matches well with similar models used in past studies \citep[e.g.,][]{WilliamsPollard}.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Figures/Meridional_flow.pdf}
    \caption{Meridional heat flow for an Earth-like planet  orbiting a Sun-like star at $1$~AU, having an atmospheric pressure of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ of $3.3\cdot10^{-4}$~bar and obliquities $0^\circ$, $23.5^\circ$, $45^\circ$, and $90^\circ$. At low obliquities, heat is transported from the equator towards the poles, while transport in the opposite direction is favored at high enough obliquities.}
    \label{fig:flow}
\end{figure}

We also track how much surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$  condenses into ice, melts, or sublimates at a given latitude and time step. The phase curve of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ employed in this model uses established data parameterized from previous 1-D radiative-convective climate models \citep{Kasting1991} and matches very well with modern data \citep{fray_sublimation_2009}. $CO_{\rm 2}$ ice forms at cold enough surface temperatures  and when the saturation pressure is reached.  The albedo of surface $CO_{\rm 2}$ ice (dry ice) in our model is 0.6 \citet{warren_spectral_1990}, which is the same value used in \citet{Turbet2017}.


\subsection{Initial conditions and parameter space}
We model the evolution of Earth-sized bodies, orbiting  F0, K5, and solar (G2) stars. We vary the initial $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ atmospheric pressure, surface temperature (cold and warm start), planetary obliquity, and semi-major axis. The initial conditions are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:ic}. If a planet starts out cold, there are initially no water clouds in the atmosphere. The global surface temperature is set to $T_{\mathrm{surf}}=230$~K, and the land snow fraction is equal to $1$ (i.e., the continents are fully covered in ice). This was done to approximate the initial conditions of \citet{Turbet2017}.

On the other hand, if a planet starts out warm, the surface temperature is set to $T_{\mathrm{surf}}=280$ K, with a land snow fraction of $0.5$. The fractional cloud cover from water vapor is $c_{\mathrm{H_{\mathrm{2}}O}}=0.26$ (resulting from Equation~\ref{ebmeq}). 
There are no $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ clouds in the initial step for either case (i.e., $c_{\mathrm{CO_{\mathrm{2}}}}=0$). These starting conditions are meant to approximately simulate the modeling conditions of \citet{Turbet2017}. However, after the initial step, both cloud coverage and surface temperatures are calculated self-consistently. 

We explore different parameters as shown in Table~\ref{tab:parameters}. We do not simulate planets located at larger semi-major axis distances than those showed in Table~\ref{tab:parameters} because modeled surface temperatures at these $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressures are below what is possible for our radiative transfer model ($T_{\mathrm{surf}}=150$~K). Nevertheless, the sampled parameter space is more than sufficient to obtain the overall trends.

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{Initial conditions for planets starting out cold and warm.}
	\label{tab:ic}
	\begin{tabular}{ccc} 
		\hline
		Parameter & \textbf{Cold start} & \textbf{Warm start} \\
		\hline
		Surface temperature $T_{\mathrm{surf}}$ [K] & 230 & 280 \\
		$H_{\mathrm{2}}O$ cloud fraction $c_{\mathrm{H_{\mathrm{2}}O}}$ & 0 & 0.26  \\
		$CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ cloud fraction $c_{\mathrm{CO_{\mathrm{2}}}}$ & 0 & 0 \\
		Land snow fraction & 1 & 0.5 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

% Similarly to \citet{Turbet2017}, the $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ clouds in our model do not absorb at any wavelengths, and thus radiatively inactive. However, even though non-absorbing, the $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ clouds still impact the planetary albedo. Their presence therefore influences the planetary surface temperature and the precipitation of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$.

\subsection{Steady-state climate regimes}

We allow the $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ partial pressure to evolve until $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ sublimation and condensation rates are balanced. Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all} shows the steady-state climate regimes obtained for initially cold and warm Earth-sized bodies having an obliquity of $23.5^{\circ}$ and orbiting different types of stars (solar twin-G2, as well as F0 and K5 stars), as a function of their orbital distance and initial atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressure.  We distinguish between four final scenarios: In the first one, the planet is completely ice-free (dark red areas in Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}). In the second one, the planet is partially covered in $H_{\mathrm{2}}O$ ice (light red areas in Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}). In the third one, the planet is partially covered in both $H_{\mathrm{2}}O$ ice and (permanent) $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice at the poles (light blue areas in Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}). In the last one, the planet is fully ice-covered and permanent $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice is present on the planetary surface (blue areas in Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}. Permanent $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice forms when condensation fluxes throughout the year outpace sublimation fluxes. 

As expected, surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation occurs at smaller orbital distances for cold start planets (left panels in Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}) as compared to bodies that start out warm (right panels in Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}).
For the solar case, the $1$~bar $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ cold start scenario exhibits surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation starting from orbital distances as small as $\sim1.2$~AU, which compares favorably to the $\sim 1.27$~AU value found by \citet{Turbet2017}. The equivalent distances for the F0 and K5 stars are $\sim2.4$~AU and $\sim0.52$~AU, respectively.
In contrast, surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation for warm starts does not occur until $\sim1.38$~AU for the $1$~bar $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ solar case, almost  $0.2$~AU farther out than for the cold start scenario. At this same pressure level, $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ surface ice starts forming at $\sim2.7$~AU and $\sim0.58$~AU for the F0 and K5 stars, respectively. This is about $0.3$~AU and $0.06$~AU farther out than for the equivalent cold start cases.
The distances beyond which surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation starts forming are pressure-dependent, as a result of the greenhouse effect of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$. At higher pressures, surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation in both warm and cold start cases occurs farther away from the host star, whereas the opposite takes place at lower pressures.

Moreover, the surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation encompasses a larger region for the hotter stars (alternatively, the red region is larger for cooler stars). This is because near-infrared absorption is lower and Rayleigh scattering is higher for planetary atmospheres orbiting hotter stars, cooling the planet and causing $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ surface ice condensation to occur closer to the star. For comparison, 1-D radiative-convective climate modeling simulations predict that planets with a $1$~bar $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ atmosphere orbiting F0, solar, and K5 stars can remain habitable at distances as far as $\sim 2.75$, $1.47$, and $0.58$~AU, respectively \citep{kasting1993, KumarKopparapu2013,Ramirez2018}, assuming the luminosity values given in Table~\ref{tab:parameters}. These values are only slightly farther out than the most distant extent of the red regions at the $1$~bar level (Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}). Although nearly the same size, the warm regions in the warm starts still span slightly smaller areas (generally) than predicted in 1-D radiative-convective climate modeling simulations \citep{kasting1993, KumarKopparapu2013,Ramirez2018}. This is because of the EBM's increased ice-albedo feedback.

A key observation from our cold starts is that a planet cannot escape full glaciation for orbital distances exceeding $\sim 2.55$, $\sim1.33$, and $\sim0.58$~AU for the F0, solar, and K5 star cold start scenarios (Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}). In these cases, the planet remains glaciated with surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation regardless of the atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ content (Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}). This difference is attributed to the weaker heat transport and higher surface albedo associated with such cold starts. Although \citet{Turbet2017} does not necessarily obtain $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ surface ice in all of these cases, in agreement with our model, they predict snowball states. 

% Similar to what is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Sketch}, at high enough atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressures the greenhouse effect dominates tends to inhibit surface ice condensation. Under these conditions $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation becomes marginal at both obliquities, consistent with trends that were also found in previous work \citep{Soto2015}. 

\subsection{Latitudinal variation of surface temperature and amount of surface $CO_{\rm 2}$ ice}
\label{sec:surf_temp}
The  average surface temperature at the last time step as a function of latitude is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:comp_a0}, for both initially cold and warm planets having an initial atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressure of $1$~bar and obliquity angles of $23.5^{\circ}$ (dashed lines) and $0^{\circ}$ (solid lines). These planets are located at intermediate orbital distances from the host star, close to the transition between ice-free and fully ice-covered bodies (see Figure \ref{fig:ss_all}). At such semi-major axes (and intermediate atmospheric $CO_{\rm 2}$ pressures), the initial state of a planet (warm or cold) is a strong predictor of  the final state of the planet. For instance, such warm start planets end up warm as well. Likewise, a cold start planet at these distances converges to a frozen solution also. In contrast, at smaller  orbital distances, the intense starlight produces warm planets regardless of the starting state. At larger semi-major axes, the reduction in starlight, combined with more intense surface $CO_{\rm 2}$ condensation, favors cold solutions (Figure \ref{fig:ss_all}). 

Low obliquity bodies receive more direct insulation at the equator, which causes large temperature differences between the latter and the poles, as well as generally lower polar surface temperatures. This also produced the tendency for equatorial surface temperatures to be higher at $0^{\circ}$ than at $23.5^{\circ}$ obliquity, especially at higher $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressures (Figure \ref{fig:comp_a0}). While this could lead to more surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice being present at higher ($23.5^{\circ}$) obliquity, we find that the portion of precipitated $CO_{\rm 2}$ is always higher for low obliquity planets having an initial atmospheric $CO_{\rm 2}$ pressure of $1$~bar (see caption in Figure \ref{fig:comp_a0}). For example, low and high obliquity planets orbiting F0 stars end up precipitating $\sim 13 \%$ and $\sim 5\%$ of atmospheric $CO_{\rm 2}$ onto the planetary surface, respectively. Conversely, obliquity variations have a smaller effect for planets orbiting cooler K5 stars, for which the surface sequestered similar amounts of atmospheric $CO_{\rm 2}$ at the two tilt angles ($\sim 0.1 \%$ at low and $\sim 0.4\%$ at high obliquity). This is because near-infrared absorption is stronger (and Rayleigh scattering is weaker) for worlds orbiting cooler stars \citep{kasting1993}. This allows for proportionately more energy to be transported across the planet, increasing the greenhouse effect and reducing the amount of surface $CO_{\rm 2}$ condensation, making K-star planets less sensitive to modest changes in obliquity.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Implications for planetary habitability on early Mars, Earth, and exoplanets}

In agreement with \citet{Turbet2017}, our model finds that $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ surface condensation can be a detriment to the habitability of cold start planets (Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}). As the dense surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice becomes sequestered within the subsurface, the atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressure decreases, which promotes even more ice formation, possibly leading to atmospheric collapse \citep{Turbet2017}. Unlike Earth, where volcanism ended snowball episodes \citep{Hoffman1342}, it might be more difficult for distant cold planets to avoid permanently glaciated conditions. This is because once $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressures exceed saturation, $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ is increasingly removed from the atmosphere before temperatures ever become warm enough. An exception to this could be volcanism rich in $H_{\mathrm{2}}$ or $CH_{\mathrm{4}}$, which could produce sufficient $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$-$H_{\mathrm{2}}$ or $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$-$CH_{\mathrm{4}}$ collision-induced absorption at high enough concentrations (percent level) and $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressures \citep{ramirez2014,wordsworth_transient_2017,ramirez2017,ramirezkalt2018,turbet_far_2019}. Nevertheless, cold start planets that are close enough to their stars receive enough energy to circumvent the above problems (Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}). 

The above provides a couple of interesting implications. Some studies argue that Mars (located at $1.52$~AU) was a cold planet that had undergone numerous transient warming episodes over geologic timescales, possibly aided by supplementary volcanic gases or other mechanisms in a predominantly $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ atmosphere \citep{wordsworth2013,batalha2016,wordsworth_transient_2017,kite_methane_2020,hayworth_warming_2020}. However, multiple sporadic warming episodes would be very difficult to achieve in practice because the excess $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ will be removed from the atmosphere once a warm period ends. This will not only enhance the ice-albedo feedback, raising the planetary albedo and triggering atmospheric collapse, but the atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ would be gradually removed from the atmospheric-surface system forever as it sinks below the less dense $H_{\mathrm{2}}O$ ice. Some estimates of the early water inventory suggest that early Mars could have had a global equivalent water layer that was at least a couple of hundred meters deep \citep{villanueva2015,ramirezetal2020}.  This would have been a sufficiently large reservoir to absorb much of the condensing surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$, decreasing the likelihood of subsequent transient warming episodes \citep{Turbet2017}. 

In the case of limit cycles for instance (see Methods), models often assume dirty low albedo (0.35) surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice \citep{batalha2016, kadoya_outer_2019,hayworth_warming_2020}. This helps reduce the absorbed stellar flux and increases the likelihood of limit cycles. However, observations suggest that the mean $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice albedo on present Mars is much higher \citep{forget2013}. So, assuming such a low albedo on a global scale may be unrealistic. Also, limit cycle models almost always assume a linear relationship between weathering rate and dissolution of H+ in groundwater \citep{batalha2016,kadoya_outer_2019,hayworth_warming_2020}. However, experiments have shown that this relationship is much weaker for real silicate rocks \citep{asolekar1991}, greatly reducing the occurrence of limit cycles \citep{ramirez2017mars}. Thus, it is not clear if such global episodic warm episodes had ever occurred on early Mars, at least during the climate optimum of maximum fluvial incision. If they did, they may have been very few in number.  

In contrast to our cold start cases, our warm start simulations suggest that the condensation of surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice affects a much smaller range of orbital distances. Irrespective of the star type, the range of semi-major axes and $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ pressures for which planets exhibit habitable surface conditions is similar to that predicted by 1-D calculations of the habitable zone \citep{kasting1993, Ramirez2018}. That said, warm start cases that are distant enough to manifest significant surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ condensation suffer the same habitability problems discussed above for cold start planets. 

These results also have implications for our own planet. The Earth, by definition, is located close enough to the star where surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation is impossible under normal circumstances (Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all}), and it would have been warm so long as the greenhouse effect, including from $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$, was potent enough. Nevertheless, the Hadean Earth likely had a $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$-rich atmosphere \citep{kasting2014}, suggesting that it was almost certainly a warm start planet, possibly facilitating an early emergence of life.

\subsection{Comparison with previous studies}

Although we obtain similar trends, our cold start results differ in certain respects from those of \citet{Turbet2017}. In particular, there are discrepancies in the spatial coverage of the red (ice-free or partially ice-covered planets) and blue (cold and icy planets displaying surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice) colored regions in Figure~\ref{fig:ss_all} between the two studies, which are likely to be mostly attributed to model differences (although there are slight differences in definition of the regions also). In particular, EBMs such as this one are quite sensitive to the ice-albedo feedback, and are thus more prone to abrupt transitions between cold and warm climate states \citep{RamirezLevi2018}. Our model also employs an atmospheric-ocean heat transport parameterization which likely produces different model behavior during the transition between icy and warm climates than what the static ocean assumption of \citet{Turbet2017} would yield. It is unclear how GCMs with fully-coupled atmospheric oceans may compare with the results presented here. This would be an interesting consideration for future studies. 

We note that at low $CO_{\rm 2}$ partial pressures surface $CO_{\rm 2}$ condensation is more easily reached than what is qualitatively shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Sketch}. However, when planets are located far away enough from the host star and/or surface temperatures are low enough (such as for cold starts), $CO_{\rm 2}$ condensation can easily take place during the evolution of the planet, once saturation pressure is reached. Some of the difference may be due to $H_{\rm 2}O$ ice cloud warming that some GCMs predict in dry and cold atmospheres, but our model does not. An alternative reason for the differences may be in the spatial and vertical distributions of clouds, which are not accurately predicted by EBMs. Furthermore, the $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ clouds formed in our simulations impact the planetary albedo, but they are non-absorbing (see Section~\ref{sec:Methods}). In contrast, the $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ clouds of \citet{Turbet2017} are either radiatively active or inactive across the entire spectrum. Nevertheless, other GCM results are consistent with 1-D results (and, in turn, the EBM results here in the location of the outer edge of the habitable zone; \citet{wolf2018erratum}).
Our warm start results agree well with those predicted from 1-D radiative-convective climate models \citep{kasting1993, KumarKopparapu2013, Ramirez2018}.

Surface condensation of $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice is highly dependent on the equator-to-pole temperature contrast, which in turn is sensitive to the diffusion coefficient $D$ (Equation~\ref{hdiff}), which includes the planetary obliquity. We compared our results with those of past GCM simulations of snowball planets \citep{hoffman_snowball_2017} to test the reliability of our diffusion parameterization. Figure~\ref{fig:Hoffman_comparison} shows the predicted latitudinally-averaged surface temperature distributions in our model. In general, our results agree quite well with the ones of \citet{hoffman_snowball_2017}, lying near the lower range of surface temperatures, similar to the FOAM (Fast Ocean Atmosphere Model) model. Some of the GCM simulations are slightly warmer than ours (except for the FOAM model) because they predict the formation of highly-absorbing upper atmospheric $H_{\rm 2}O$ ice clouds in these cold and (otherwise) dry atmospheres. More models should test this result. Nevertheless, we conclude that our employed heat diffusion parameterization is reasonable and consistent with previous studies.

\begin{figure}

    \caption{Average surface temperature as a function of latitude obtained using initial conditions corresponding to the GCM by \citet{hoffman_snowball_2017} (Figure 8a), for initial atmospheric $CO_{\rm 2}$ contents of $0.11$~mbar and $100$~mbar. The surface albedo was set to $0.6$ everywhere while planetary obliquity and eccentricity were set to $23.5^{\circ}$, and zero, respectively.}
    \label{fig:Hoffman_comparison}
\end{figure}

In summary, the main differences between EBMs and GCMs are mainly related to how large scale dynamics (which might lead to sharper climatic transitions) and clouds are treated, whose spatial and vertical distributions cannot be accurately predicted by EBMs. Nevertheless, EBMs are computationally efficient,  enabling exploration of a wide parameter space, which would be computational expensive with GCMs. Furthermore, since this study mainly addresses different climatic trends and distributions, EBMs such as this one are appropriate tools. 
Nevertheless, improved observations are needed to test how well climate models, irrespective of complexity, agree with reality.

\section{Conclusions}
Planets similar to Earth might experience cold or warm stages during the course of their evolution. The carbonate-silicate cycle can stabilize planetary temperatures over geological timescales. While  $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ generally increases surface temperature, high enough atmospheric $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ can trigger atmospheric collapse via $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ surface ice condensation (starting at the poles), leading to irreversible glaciation. Such a process could negatively impact the habitability of terrestrial bodies, even if located within the canonical habitable zone. This was argued in \citet{Turbet2017}, whom showed that surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation on initially frozen planets orbiting the Sun can significantly reduce the range of habitable orbital distances. 

Our work here confirms these results and extends the analysis to rapidly-rotating planets under different starting temperature conditions orbiting a range of star types (F - K). Using a latitudinally-dependent EBM, we show that planets that start out warm generally exhibit surface $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice condensation at significantly larger orbital distances than cold start (i.e., fully glaciated with $T_{\mathrm{surf}}=230$~K) planets. This implies a wide habitable zone, consistent with what had been previously computed using simpler 1-D models \citep{kasting1993,KumarKopparapu2013,Ramirez2018}. Although our model predicts that this zone remains similarly wide across obliquities, we find that inefficient poleward heat transport leads to more surface  $CO_{\mathrm{2}}$ ice production at lower ($0^{\circ}$) obliquity. Finally, our heat diffusion parameterization provides a simple way of evaluating a range of warm and cold climates with minimal tuning of parameters. 

The physics of planetary atmospheres remain complex, particularly for planets unlike the Earth. Future work should continue to use a hierarchy of models to explore the effects of clouds, convection, and the impact that oceans have on the overall heat transport.
